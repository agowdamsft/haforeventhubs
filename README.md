# Reference Implementation & Best Practices for Azure Event Hubs High Availability ImplementationsProject for building High Availability 
## Overview
Often times when building highly scalable low tolerence appplications you need to design architecture to help architect this low RTO/RPO times when the implementation uses Azure Event Hubs as a data ingestion platform. 
## Problem Statement To  be Addressed  
“As an application architect I would like good practice architecture/implementations for running HA Event Hubs with multi-region deployments that can allow low RTO/RRP for replicating messages with minimal impact on consumers and producers that can scale and perform  for 15 MB/sec ingress of messages”
